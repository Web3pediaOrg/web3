    "content":"What is an NFT?\\n\\n NFT stands for Non-fungible token. “Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. NFTs can be used to represent ownership of unique items.\\nThey let us tokenise things like art, collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one official owner at a time and they're secured by the Ethereum blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence. The tokens aren't necessarily images, though: on several websites, such as Decentraland and The Sandbox, you can buy virtual land in NFT form.\\n\\n How Does NFT works?\\n\\n At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. It is worth noting that other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs.\\n\\n How are NFTs traded? \\n\\n Like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are bought and sold on specialised platforms. OpenSea is the best-known NFT marketplace. To purchase an NFT, the wallet must contain enough of the relevant cryptocurrency -- for example, ether (ETH) if the person is buying a token on the Ethereum blockchain.\\n With a little technical know-how, it is also possible to make, or 'mint', your own NFT. Ultimately, NFTs are digital contracts, with certain rules embedded such as the number of copies available for sale."
