    "content":"<h3>What's a Minning?</h3>Mining is the process that helps create new blocks of transactions to be added to the Ethereum blockchain network.<br></div><h3>Who can become a miner on the Ethereum network?</h3>Technically, anyone is able to mine on the Ethereum network using their computer. However, not everyone is able to mine Ether profitably.In most cases, miners must purchase dedicated computer hardware in order to mine profitably.<br></body><h3>Different methods of Mining</h3><ul><li><b>CPU mining</b> - This is a quite slow way of mining, because it takes months to earn a tiny amount of mining rewards. Also constantly running CPU at 100% of its capacity increases the electrical cost.</li><li><b>GPU mining</b> - This is a most common way of minning these days. Mining process requires higher efficiency in performing similar kinds of repetitive computations. The mining device continuously tries to decode the different hashes repeatedly with only one digit changing in each attempt. GPUs are equipped with a large number of Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU), which are responsible for performing mathematical computations. Courtesy of these ALUs, the GPU is capable of performing more calculations, leading to improved output for the crypto mining process.</li><li><b>Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) mining</b> - This type of mining is also quite popular. These are integrated circuit chip that has been designed for a specific purpose. But they are expensive, and as more and more miners join the network and mining becomes harder, the hardware becomes obsolete quickly. A brand new ASIC would usually only last 1-2 years max.</li></ul><h3>Mining Pools</h3>Cryptocurrency mining pools are groups of miners who share their computational resources. Mining pools utilize these combined resources to strengthen the probability of finding a block or otherwise successfully mining for cryptocurrency. If the mining pool is successful and receives a reward, that reward is divided among participants in the pool."
